# nix-config

*My personal nix-darwin configuration*

## Why

Nix reminds me of Gentoo. I spent a part of my life getting Gentoo to work, so why not spend the rest with Nix?
Jokes aside, I've always did (tried) to keep most of my setup under version control, did symlinks, scripts, Brewfile, 

I can perform this sort of magic thanks to amazing people who shared their own experiences and made configurations public ( [just search nix-config in github](https://github.com/search?q=nix-config+darwin&type=repositories)), so I feel obliged to do the same.

## What

- **[nix](https://nixos.org/)**: A package manager and a distribution-independent package manager system that focuses on declarative and functional package management.
- **[nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin)**: An extension of Nix that focuses on managing the configuration of macOS systems.
- **[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)**: An add-on for Nix that focuses on managing user-level environments.

## How

TBD
